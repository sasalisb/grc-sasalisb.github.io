        <h1>Officina vs. FF Meta </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Officina</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Spiekermann created Officina in 1990 in Southern Italy. He hopes to create a family of type that would be well-suited for business documentation and correspondence. When ITC Officina was produced, this typeface proved to have capabilities beyond its original intention.</p>
             
			 <h3>FF Meta</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>FF Meta was designed by Erik Spiekermann in 1991 at the West German Post Office. The typeface was intended to be a “antithesis of Helvetica.”</p>

            <p>FF Meta and ITC Officina Sans share some similarities, such as their legibility and modern design approach, however they have subtle but distinctive difference in their visual style and personality.</p>

             <h3>Differences</h3>
            <p>Meta is a more modern and versatile typeface that is suitable for a wider range of applications. While Officina, on the other hand, has a more classic feel, making it well-suited to editorial and publishing work. Looking at both typefaces from afar, it really doesn’t look like there is much of a difference between the two, however, when you take a closer look at the “g” for example, there is a significant difference between the two typefaces.  Another note to add is that the ends of the upper-case strokes (Y, X, W, K) are slanted for Officina and horizontal for Meta.</p>
