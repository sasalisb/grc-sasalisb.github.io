               <h3>2022-2023 Lookbook</h3>
               <p>
                  The latest Wedding dress trends speak of desires for timelessness blended with modern bridal accents and daring new interpretations.
                  With New York Bridal Week recently wrapping up, there were a variety of dresses that caught our eye. From gowns with huge ruffles to designs with sensual cutouts. This season’s designers certainly didn’t play it safe, opting for brightly coloured gowns and experimenting with diverse sleeve designs. The Fall 2022 collections emphasised the variety of wedding fashion, demonstrating that no matter what your bridal taste is, you’ll find a look you love when it’s time to say “I do.”
                  We spoke to Megan Ziems, founder and creative director of Grace Loves Lace, to fill you in on all the wedding dress trends you don’t want to miss out on.

                  <p>
                     We'll notice a continued shift towards bold and statement-making pieces, for both gowns and accessories. “We are expecting to see fashion which is flamboyant and non-apologetic,” the designer tells Brides.

                  <h3>Having fun</h3>
                  <p>
                     Hundreds of hours are spent planning a wedding.  Picking out the wedding dress, location, date, who to invite, choosing the vendors etc.  In the minds of most couples is to make sure their guests have a great time on the wedding day.  The one thing that can be forgotten is making sure the couple has fun too.

                  <p>
                     Looking for those perfect wedding shoes to accent your wedding dress?  Just as every wedding gown is unique in cut, style and fabric, so are your wedding shoes.  Finding the perfect shoes requires special attention.  Your shoes not only  complement your dress and theme, they must compliment you.

                  <h3>All About Veils</h3>
                  <p>
                     A veil is a romantic addition to any wedding dress. It's usually a piece of tulle fabric that complements the dress, but it does not have to be. Whether your style skews ball gown or tea-length, it adds the perfect finishing touch.

                  <h3>Finding Your Dress</h3>
                  <p>
                     At the end of the day it is your wedding and looking and feeling like your most natural comfortable self is the best thing to do. Saying YES to the dress doesn’t come straight away to most bride’s and don’t get disheartened by that. Your yes moment will come, and it might come the next day after you’ve had a night to think about it. Take that extra night before saying yes if you need it and once you do a huge weight will be lifted.

                  <h3>Alteration Tips and Tricks</h3>
                  <p>
                     Most wedding dresses are made in generic sizes, so very rarely does a bride’s body match a designer’s dress perfectly (for example, your gown might fit like a glove in the hips, but too loose in the bust). After you find your wedding dress, the bridal salon compares your measurements to the designer’s size chart and orders the closest size of gown. Once it arrives, the dress must then be tailored precisely to fit your figure.

                  <h3>Who to Bring Dress Shopping</h3>
                  <p>
                     When it comes to inviting people, choose wisely. Bring along the people that are going to give you the most helpful advice and lift you up. For most brides we see coming through Eternal Bridal it’s their mum, sister or best friend. Don’t bring too many people, because you still want to keep the dress a surprise for everyone, not just your partner.
