               <h2>2022-2023 Lookbook</h2>
               <p>The latest Wedding dress trends speak of desires for timelessness blended with modern bridal accents and daring new interpretations.
                  With New York Bridal Week recently wrapping up, there were a variety of dresses that caught our eye. From gowns with huge ruffles to designs with sensual cutouts. This season’s designers certainly didn’t play it safe, opting for brightly coloured gowns and experimenting with diverse sleeve designs. The Fall 2022 collections emphasised the variety of wedding fashion, demonstrating that no matter what your bridal taste is, you’ll find a look you love when it’s time to say “I do.”
                  We spoke to Megan Ziems, founder and creative director of Grace Loves Lace, to fill you in on all the wedding dress trends you don’t want to miss out on.

               <p>“The pandemic has certainly shed a light on business practices and Couples have never been more invested in the social impact of brands – for the Wedding and beyond! With Brides, in particular, we’ve noticed more Women doing their due diligence and aligning their Wedding Dress purchase with their core values. Now more than ever, Brides want to purchase from brands that champion sustainable and ethical manufacturing and they aren’t afraid to ask where their dress will be made. Luckily for us, our wedding gowns have always been designed and manufactured in Australia, so we haven’t had to deal with what over 80% of the wedding industry has had to deal with – which is delays in manufacturing in China.”</p>

               <p>“2022 will be all about making a timeless and classic wedding gown exciting! I think we’ll see an interest for creative and luxurious fabric combinations. Lots of contrasting elements. Hidden yet decadent trims and details. Comfort will continue to be key as women recognise that being a bride for the day isn’t about wearing a corset or heavy gown – it’s about being able to move and dance while letting your hair down! I think we will also see couples opting to change into second looks for the reception, allowing the bride to expand her wedding wardrobe by getting adventurous with a party dress!”</p>

               <p>Designers went to the runway this season to show off their most recent creations, which will be worn by brides all around the world in the next year. While several of our favourite styles, such as the strapless ballgown and floral applique, made a comeback on the runways, there were also a few new and returning wedding dress trends that brides-to-be should be aware of.
                  The Spring 2023 designs provide a fresh new perspective on what it means to be a bride today, with styles that reflect the delight that many women will experience throughout this new era of marriages. There will be a combination of traditional and modern fashions, seductive and classic aesthetics, and voluminous and sleek shapes, appealing to every bride-to-be like never before.
                  Bows have been a wedding staple for a long time, but their victorious resurgence is defined by their dramatic extravagance and adaptability. Detachable bow trains and hair ornaments are among the contemporary touches that represent the historic nature of the looks and are very much part of this seasons wedding dress trends.

                     We'll notice a continued shift towards bold and statement-making pieces, for both gowns and accessories. “We are expecting to see fashion which is flamboyant and non-apologetic,” the designer tells Brides.

                  <p>
                     Bridal details are extremely important because they help set the album spread.. and tell the story of the day even better. It is good to schedule ample time for this part, because they set the stage for the look of the entire wedding!
